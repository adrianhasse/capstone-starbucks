# capstone-starbucks

## Motivation

The Starbucks project is a udacity capstone project which refers to an interesting business case that I believe many companies are trying to address. Knowing which offers attract customers to the stores or increase their willingness to buy can be a significant competitive advantage.

The project includes simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, which will be further analyzed. The data includes information about potential offers, customers and transactions. This allows us to know for a specific customer group which offers they received and when they spent how much.

The focus of this repository is on the question of how likely it is that a particular offer will achieve its goal. In other words, when a customer receives an offer, how likely is it that it will be completed. Therefore data preparation, feature engineering, data visualization and modelling is part of this repository.

## Used libraries
I used pandas and numpy for data handling, scikit learn for data processing and modelling and matplotlib and scipy for data visualisation.

## Files
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Notebook contains the data analysis including visualizations, data preparation and feature engineering.
/data: Folder contains all the neccessary data for this anlaysis

## Results
A random forest model is presented to which yields to acceptable results. Furthermore a feature importance analysis is presented.
